     <p>Hello, I am Eldanya.</p>
     <p> I was born in South Africa Mpumulanga. When I was 3 we moved to
       CapeTown where I was inspired by the artists who sat at the beach sketching
       people. I always had a passion of creating art and designs. I started
       exploring with different mediums, like paint, ink and pencil. In highschool
       I had art, design and engineering graphic design (EGD) as my best subjects.
       <br><br>
       In matric I got destinctions for all 3 and even won the throphy for the best
       design student. I then decided to move to Pretoria Gauteng to study graphic
       design, where I learned how to work many design programs, code websites, film
       and photograpy. I love learnig about the history of art and design. In my
       spare time I make tiny clay models that I turn into necklaces. My favourate
       mediums I do art with are water paint and blue pen sketches.
